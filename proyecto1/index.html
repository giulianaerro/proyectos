            Colorado. When he was two years old, the family moved to San<br>
            Anselmo, California, where filmmaker George Lucas was one of his<br>
            neighbors. cher was fascinated with filmmaking from the age of<br>
            eight. After watching the documentary on the making of Butch Cassidy<br>
            and the Sundance Kid (1969), he began making films at age eight with<br>
            an 8mm camera. In his teens, Fincher moved to Ashland, Oregon,<br>
            where he attended Ashland High School. He directed plays and <br>
            designed sets and lighting after school, and was a non-union <br>
            projectionist at a second-run movie theater, as well as a production <br>
            assistant at the local television news station, KOBI in Medford, <br>
            Oregon. While establishing himself in the film industry, Fincher <br>
            was employed at John Korty's studio as a production head. Gaining <br>
            further experience, he became a visual effects producer, working on <br>
            the animated Twice Upon a Time (1983) with George Lucas. In 1990, <br>
